### Hello World!

I am a doctoral student at the [Universität Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/en/), working in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.uibk.ac.at/mathematik/index.html.en).
I am generally interested in category theory and its applications, and I currently work in categorical probability under the guidance of [Tobias Fritz](http://tobiasfritz.science/).
I am also interested in other work with categorical themes, such as probabilistic programming, denotational semantics and type theory.

Academics aside, I enjoy reading and listening to music or podcasts (particularly when I'm engaged in "grunt" work).

I completed a Master degree in Mathematics at the [Universität Regensburg](http://tobiasfritz.science/) under the supervision of [Denis-Charles Cisinski](https://cisinski.app.uni-regensburg.de/).
I earned my Bachelors degree from the [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/)

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
